# BrightnessPerceptionOfTwoFrameRates
 Repository for the Master Thesis "Investigating Effects of Brightness Perception of Higher Frame Rate Footage" by David Kovacs.
 
 MATLAB code "Experimental_SetUp_PTB.m" sets up a displaying pipeline with the use of Psychtoolbox to display frames in the resolution of UHD and the maximum temporal resolution of the output device. An experiment is performed to compare the brightness perception of two different frame rates shown in one image. By pressing an arrow key the subject can indicate which frame rate was perceived as brighter. After a key response the current stimulus is terminated and the next stimulus will be shown automatically after 5 seconds. More detailed and additional information can be found in the thesis.
